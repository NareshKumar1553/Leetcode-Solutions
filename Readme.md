# LeetCode Solutions (Java & Python)

This repository is a collection of my solutions to LeetCode problems, organized by difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard) for daily practice and learning. The code primarily uses Java and Python, focusing on brute force techniques to build a strong foundation for problem-solving.

## Directory Structure

The repository follows this structure:
```bash
leetcode-solutions/
├── Easy/
│   ├── problem1_name/
│   │   ├── problem1.java (if Java solution exists)
│   │   ├── problem1.py (if Python solution exists)
│   │   └── Explanation.md (optional, for detailed explanations)
│   ├── problem2_name/
│   │   ... (same structure)
│   └── ... (more Easy problems)
├── Medium/
│   └── ... (similar structure for Medium problems)
└── Hard/
└── ... (similar structure for Hard problems)

- Each problem folder is named descriptively, reflecting the problem title.
- Within each problem folder, you can have separate files for Java (`problemX.java`) and Python (`problemX.py`) solutions.
- An optional `Explanation.md` file can be included to provide a more detailed breakdown of the solution approach and thought process.
```
## Contributing

This repository is primarily for your personal learning, but feel free to share it publicly if you wish. Here are some ways to contribute:

- Add new solutions to LeetCode problems you've tackled.
- Refine existing solutions for better efficiency or code clarity.
- Include `Explanation.md` files to document your thought process.

## Learning with Brute Force

Brute force is a valuable technique for understanding core problem-solving concepts. It involves trying all possible solutions until you find the correct one. While it may not be the most optimized approach for every case, it helps build a solid foundation for more advanced algorithms.

As you progress through LeetCode, you may encounter situations where brute force becomes less practical. Feel free to explore other approaches like dynamic programming, recursion, or data structures to enhance your problem-solving toolkit.

## Disclaimer

The solutions provided here might not be the most optimized. The focus is on understanding the problem, applying fundamental techniques, and practicing your coding skills. Consider exploring alternative approaches and optimizations as you advance in your learning journey.

I hope this repository serves as a valuable tool for your daily LeetCode practice and skill development!

Additional Tips:

Consider using a version control system like Git to track changes and collaborate if you choose to share the repository publicly.

Explore LeetCode's built-in discussion forums to gain insights from other users and learn different problem-solving approaches.

As you master brute force, gradually introduce more efficient algorithms like dynamic programming, recursion, and data structures to expand your problem-solving arsenal.

Focus on code readability and maintainability by adding comments and using clear variable names.

Happy LeetCoding!
